 - Question 1:

   - What does `gsub()` do in this code block? (hint: use the online help in R using the '?' symbol.)

	 `TODO`

 - Question 2:

   - What is shown in Plot 1?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 3:

   - Plot 2 is a scaled view of the same information from Plot 1. How does Plot 2 provide more information than Plot 1?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 4:

   - What does `mutate()` do in this code block?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 5:

   - What does `summarise()` do in this code block?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 6:

   - Apart from the colors red and blue used to draw the points, what is the main difference between Plot 3a and Plot 3b? Is Plot 3b more informative than Plot 3a?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 7:

   - Interpret the results of Plot 4 in terms of the magnitude of the y-axis.

	 `TODO`

 - Question 8:

   - In Plot 5, both of the previous plots have been combined together on the same canvas. How does this, either help or confuse the output of the analysis?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 9:

   - What do the whiskers (i.e., the big "I" shaped structures above each histogram bar) convey in this plot? Why might we need to know this information?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 10:

   -  The word, "function" is below in the code block. What does this part of the code do? Why do you suppose that it is necessary?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 11:

   -  Some time is necessary to generate the variable, "ProbeR2". What is taking this code block so long to complete? What is the "lm()" function in R?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 12:

   -  With the above ideas about R-squared values in mind, which Probe in Plot 8 appears to be able to best explain the model?

	 `TODO`

 - Question 13:

   -  In Plot 9 we see two curves. What can you infer about the relationships between the Actual cases of relationships and those cases for which no relationship exists? Remember, the blue curve corresponds to the variable "r2" and the red curve corresponds to the Null values.

	 `TODO`

 - Question 14:

   -  Plot 10 is very important to determine a result concerning the Actual data sets and the Null data sets. Other than showing colored points, what does one conclude from Plot 10 about the above analysis?

### Questions in Blue (Ethics)

 1. Discuss what is meant by the term _autonomy_.

  `TODO`

 2. What can go wrong in technology to create a such a leak that they mention.

  `TODO`

 3. The authors mention that paper records could only be viewed by one person at a time. In this case, each medical record would have to be check-out at the medical records room in a hospital. In your opinion, do you think that this would be a better form of security for the records, even though the process of getting to the records would be extremely slow for the doctors who require this information?

  `TODO`

 4. The authors also mention that, _Clinical personnel often have little knowledge of the clinic's workflow and the roles others play in care delivery._ How could this lack of coordination be an ethical problem?

  `TODO`

   `TODO`


 - What did the speaker discuss?

  `TODO`


 - How is this message related to our course in Data Analytics?

  `TODO`
